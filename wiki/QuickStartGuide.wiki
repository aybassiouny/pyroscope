*⚠ WARNING:* Older xmlrpc-c libraries on Ubuntu have a bug regarding integer overflows (causing bigger data sizes like those of Linux distribution DVDs to be misreported), see [http://code.google.com/p/rtgui/wiki/CompilingRtorrent this page] for details on how to fix it. If your installation has that problem, the `rtxmlrpc` and `rtcontrol` commands will emit a warning every time you start them.
