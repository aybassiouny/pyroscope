*⚠ WARNING:* `xmlrpc-c` libraries on Ubuntu tend to have a bug regarding integer overflows, causing bigger data sizes like those of Linux distribution DVDs to be misreported. If your installation has that problem, the `rtxmlrpc` and `rtcontrol` commands will emit a warning every time you start them. In that case follow DebianInstallFromSource or [http://code.google.com/p/rtgui/wiki/CompilingRtorrent the rtgui instructions] to compile your own correct version.
