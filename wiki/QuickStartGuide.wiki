#summary How to get started - installation and first steps.

= For the Impatient =

Requirements:
 * an existing rTorrent installation
 * Python 2.5 or a higher 2.x version
 * currently, a proper build environment (see below) and a subversion client

Initial installation:
{{{
mkdir -p ~/lib
svn checkout http://pyroscope.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ~/lib/pyroscope
cd ~/lib/pyroscope
source bootstrap.sh
}}}

To later update the software, use these commands:
{{{
cd ~/lib/pyroscope
svn update
source bin/activate
paver develop -U
}}}


= Details of Installation =

Currently, the only way to install and use the software is from source, as outlined above.

== Package Dependencies ==
On Debian and Ubuntu, you'll need the following packages installed:
{{{
aptitude install python2.5 python-virtualenv python-dev
aptitude install build-essential devtools
}}}
