= For the Impatient =

Requirements:
 * an existing rTorrent installation
 * Python 2.5 or a higher 2.x version
 * currently, a proper build environment (see below) and a subversion client

Initial installation:
{{{
mkdir -p ~/lib
svn checkout http://pyroscope.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ~/lib/pyroscope
cd ~/lib/pyroscope
source bootstrap.sh
}}}

After that, the CommandLineTools are available in the `~/lib/pyroscope/bin` directory.

= Details of Installation =

Currently, the only way to install and use the software is from source, as outlined above.

== Package Dependencies ==
On Debian and Ubuntu, you'll need the following packages installed:
{{{
aptitude install python2.5 python-virtualenv python-dev
aptitude install inkscape build-essential devtools
}}}

If there are packages missing from that list, leave a comment.

== Updating to the Latest SVN Version ==
To update the software after initial installation, use these commands:
{{{
cd ~/lib/pyroscope
svn update
source bin/activate
paver develop -U
}}}


= Configuration =
_The file system paths in the following sections have to be adapted to your installation, of course._

== `rTorrent` Configuration ==
In your `~/.rtorrent.rc` file, add or change these lines:
{{{
scgi_local = ~/lib/rtorrent/.scgi_local
}}}
Then restart it.

== `PyroScope` Basic Configuration ==
Create the `~/.pyroscope` directory and ...
{{{
mkdir -p ~/.pyroscope/{log,www-data}
}}}

== Enabling the Queue Manager ==
*NOT IMPLEMENTED*

Using `crontab -e`, add the following to your cron schedule:
{{{
* * * * *   test -S ~/lib/rtorrent/.scgi_local && ~/lib/pyroscope/bin/pyro-qm
}}}

== Starting the Web Interface ==
To use the web server, you first have to make a config file as follows:
{{{
paster make-config pyroscope ~/.pyroscope/web.ini
}}}

Tweak the config file as appropriate and then start the web server in daemon mode:
{{{
paver start
}}}
If you did not change the web server parameters, you can now view the start page at http://127.0.0.1:8042/. You can use the `paver status` command to check on the server status, and `paver stop` to stop a running server.
