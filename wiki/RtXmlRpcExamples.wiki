= General Maintenance Taks =
Here are some commands that can help with managing your rTorrent instance:
{{{
# Flush ALL session data NOW, use this before you make a backup of your session directory
rtxmlrpc d.multicall main d.save_session=
# [[1], [1], ..., [1]]
}}}


= Setting and checking throttles =
To set the speed of the `slow` throttle, and then check your new limit and print the current download rate, use:
{{{
rtxmlrpc throttle_down slow 120
# 0
rtxmlrpc get_throttle_down_max slow 
# 122880
rtxmlrpc get_throttle_down_rate slow 
# 0
}}}
Note that the speed is specified in KiB/s as a string when setting it but returned in bytes/s as an integer on queries.
