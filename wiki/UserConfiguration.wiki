#summary PyroScope configuration.

= Introduction =

Configuration is loaded from the directory `~/.pyroscope` containing the files `config.ini` and `config.py`. Both files are optional â€” for simple setups, you only need to edit the plain text file `config.ini`.

The script `config.py` allows much more detailed control over complex setups, at the price of you knowing at least the basics of the Python programming language.


= Creating a set of default configuration files =

To create your own configuration, the best way is to start from the default files that are part of your PyroScope installation. To create them at the default location `~/.pyroscope`, simply call this command:
{{{
pyroadmin --create-config
}}}

If you need several distinct configuration sets, just add the `--config-dir` option like so:
{{{
pyroadmin --create-config --config-dir ~/rtorrent/special/.pyroscope
}}}

To view your configuration, use this (again, use the `--config-dir` option for non-default configurations):
{{{
pyroadmin --dump-config
}}}


= Setting values in `config.ini` =

The configuration file consists of sections, led by a `[section]` header and followed by `name: value` entries; `name = value` is also accepted. Longer values can be broken into several lines and the continuation lines must be indented (start with a space). Note that leading whitespace is removed from values. 

Lines beginning with a semicolon (`;`), a hash mark (`#`), or the letters `REM` (uppercase or lowercase) will be ignored and can be used for comments. You cannot put a comment on an option line, a comment *MUST* start the beginning of a line!

As an example, this is a very minimal condiguration file: 
{{{
# PyroScope configuration file

[DEFAULT]
rtorrent_rc = ~/.rtorrent.rc

[ANNOUNCE]
# Add alias names for announce URLs to this section; those aliases are used
# at many places, e.g. by the "mktor" tool
PBT = http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce
OBT = http://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce
Debian = http://bttracker.debian.org:6969/announce
}}}

_For advanced users:_ Values can contain format strings of the form `%(name)s` which refer to other values in the same section, or values in the `[DEFAULT]` section.
