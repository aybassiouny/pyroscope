= Introduction =
The following is intended to become a comprehensive reference of all the rTorrent XMLRPC commands, a thing which is sorely missing from rTorrent's own documentation.
The information here pertains to version 0.8.6 of rTorrent, which has 460 built-in methods.

Also see these pages for similar ressources:
  * the rTorrent wiki has a very incomplete [http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki/RTorrentCommands list of commands]; other information is scattered over the other wiki pages, and Trac tickets.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/gi-torrent/wiki/rTorrent_XMLRPC_reference gi-torrrent's draft reference]
