#summary How to get started - preparing a Python runtime environment.
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Creating an isolated Python environment in your account =
If you lack the right for global installing, or just wish to keep things separate and limited to your account, the following will allow you to do just that.

*⚠ NOTE:* This assumes that any version of Python 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7 is already installed on the machine — call the command `python --version` to check.

First, we create the Python virtual environment:
{{{
mkdir -p ~/bin ~/lib/pyroscope
cd ~/lib/pyroscope
venv='https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/raw/master/virtualenv.py'
python -c "import urllib2; open('venv.py','w').write(urllib2.urlopen('$venv').read())"
deactivate 2>/dev/null
python venv.py --no-site-packages $(pwd)
}}}

Now, continue to either install a release version *as described in the next section*, or from source as shown on the InstallFromSource page. The QuickStartGuide helps you to decide what's the right way for you.

= Installing a release version =

If you want to install a release version, the next step is all you need for success:
{{{
~/lib/pyroscope/bin/easy_install pyrocore
ln -nfs $(grep -l 'entry_point.*pyrocore==' ~/lib/pyroscope/bin/*) ~/bin/
}}}
And yes, this requires you to [http://linux.about.com/od/linux101/l/blnewbie3_1_4.htm add ~/bin to your PATH], if you didn't do that yet. Now head back to [InstallReleaseVersion#Completing_your_setup].
