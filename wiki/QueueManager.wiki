= Introduction =
The queue manager is controlled by the `pyrotorque` daemon command.

*At the moment, run `pyrotorque` manually in a `tmux` or `screen` session _after_ starting rTorrent. There will be some form of auto-start/watchdog later on to run it and keep it alive.*


= Initial setup =

The queue manager needs additional configuration, but there are defaults in place, so the following explanation can be skipped if you are OK with these.

If you followed the UserConfiguration instructions, the necessary commands are added automatically to your `.rtorrent.rc` using the [https://pyroscope.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyrocore/src/pyrocore/data/config/rtorrent-0.8.6.rc configuration include]. Look for the section starting with a `# QUEUE MANAGER` comment near the end, if for whatever reason you need to add these manually.

Also, the PyroScope configuration (located in `~/.pyroscope/config.ini`) needs some additions, namely in the new `[TORQUE]` section. Again, this is covered by [http://pyroscope.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyrocore/src/pyrocore/data/config/rtorrent-0.8.6.rc defaults], so you only need to take care of that if you want to make any changes.
