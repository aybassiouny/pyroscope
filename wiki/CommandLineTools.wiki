= Commands =

== mktor ==
`mktor` creates `*.torrent` files (metafiles), given the path to a file or directory and a tracker URL. Optionally, you can also set an additional comment and a different name for the resulting torrent file. Peer exchange and DHT can be disabled by using the `--private` option. 

As a unique feature, if you want to change the root directory of the torrent to something different than the basename of the data directory, you can do so with the `--root-name` option. This is especially useful if you have hierarchical paths like `documents/2009/myproject/specs` - normally, all the context information but `specs` would be lost on the receiving side.

If you create several torrents on the same data for different trackers, they're automatically enabled for cross-seeding. For the technically inclined, this is done by adding a unique key so that the info hash is always different.

== lstor ==
`lstor` lists the contents of bittorrent metafiles. The resulting output looks like this:
