<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

The following is an explanation of the collaped display of [RtorrentExtended rTorrent-PS] — remember that you need to bind a key to the `view.collapsed.toggle` command, or set the default of a view by calling that command in the configuration, else you won't ever see it.

|| ☢ || Item state (▹ = started, ╍ = paused, ▪ = stopped) ||
|| ☍ || Tied item? [⚯] ||

|| ✰ || Priority (✖ = off, ⇣ = low, nothing for normal, ⇡ = high) ||

|| ⚡ || Transfer direction indicator [⇅ ↡ ↟] ||
|| ☯ || Ratio (☹  plus color indication for < 1, ➀  — ➉ : >= the number, ⊛ : >= 11) ||
|| ⚑ || Message (♺ = Tracker cycle complete, i.e. "Tried all trackers"; ⚡ = establishing connection; ↯ = data transfer problem; ◔ = timeout; ¿? = unknown torrent / info hash; ⨂ = authorization problem (possibly temporary); ⚠ = other) ||
|| ↺ || Number of completions from last scrape info ||

The scrape info numbers are exact only for values < 100, 
else they indicate the order of magnitude using roman numerals 
(c = 10², m = 10³, X = 10⁴, C = 10⁵, M = 10⁶).

For the completion time display to work, you need the following in your `.rtorrent.rc`, which you already do if you installed PyroScope correctly:
{{{
system.method.set_key = event.download.finished,time_stamp,"d.set_custom=tm_completed,$cat=$system.time= ;d.save_session="
}}}
