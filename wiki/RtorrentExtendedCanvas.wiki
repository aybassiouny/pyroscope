#summary Details on the collapsed download list display.
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

The following is an explanation of the collaped display of [RtorrentExtended rTorrent-PS] — remember that you need to bind a key to the `view.collapsed.toggle` command, or set the default of a view by calling that command in the configuration, else you won't ever see it.

|| *Column* || *Description* ||
|| ☢ || Item state (▹ = started, ╍ = paused, ▪ = stopped) ||
|| ☍ || Tied item? [⚯] ||
|| ⌘ || Command lock-out? (⚒ = heed commands, ◌ = ignore commands) ||
|| ✰ || Priority (✖ = off, ⇣ = low, nothing for normal, ⇡ = high) ||
|| ⣿ || Completion status (✔ = done; else up to 8 dots [⣿], i.e. 9 levels of 11% each) ||
|| ⚡ || Transfer direction indicator [⇅ ↡ ↟] ||
|| ☯ || Ratio (☹  plus color indication for < 1, ➀  — ➉ : >= the number, ⊛ : >= 11) ||
|| ⚑ || Message (♺ = Tracker cycle complete, i.e. "Tried all trackers"; ⚡ = establishing connection; ↯ = data transfer problem; ◔ = timeout; ¿? = unknown torrent / info hash; ⨂ = authorization problem (possibly temporary); ⚠ = other) ||
|| ↺ || Number of completions from last scrape info ||
|| ⤴ || Number of seeds from last scrape info ||
|| ⤵ || Number of leeches from last scrape info ||
|| ∆ || Upload rate ||
|| ⌚ ≀∇ || Approximate time since completion (units are «”’hdwmy» from seconds to years); for incomplete items the download rate or, if there's no traffic, the time since the item was loaded ||
|| ✇ || Data size ||
|| Name || Name of the download item ||
|| Tracker Domain || Domain of the first HTTP tracker with seeds or leeches, or else the first one altogether ||

The scrape info numbers are exact only for values < 100, 
else they indicate the order of magnitude using roman numerals 
(c = 10², m = 10³, X = 10⁴, C = 10⁵, M = 10⁶).

For the completion time display to work, you need the following in your `.rtorrent.rc`, which you already do if you installed PyroScope correctly (i.e. using the standard `.rtorrent.rc` include):
{{{
system.method.set_key = event.download.finished,time_stamp,"d.set_custom=tm_completed,$cat=$system.time= ;d.save_session="
}}}

The font used in the above example is `Inconsolata`, and whatever font you use in your terminal profile, it of course has to support the characters used in the status columns. Also, your terminal *must* be set to use UTF-8 (which nowadays usually is the default anyway), that means `LANG` should be something like `en_US.UTF-8`, and `LC_ALL` and `LC_CTYPE` should *not* bet set at all!

On Windows using PuTTY (version 0.60), change the settings for font and character set as follows:
 * `DejaVu Sans Mono` in `Window / Appearance`
 * `UTF-8` in `Window / Translation`

The following command lets you easily check whether your font supports all the necessary characters and your terminal is configured correctly:
{{{
