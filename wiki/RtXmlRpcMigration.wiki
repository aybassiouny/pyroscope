= Changes after 0.8.7 =
Version 0.8.7 is the last version that supports the "old" command set.

The following is a mapping table from old to new commands, which can be added to the `[XMLRPC]` section of the configuration file:

{{{
d.save_session = d.save_full_session
}}}

Please add any commands you needed to map in your installation as a comment to this page, and also provide version information if possible (SVN revision).
