#summary Different statistics about the available torrents and assembled data.

== Trackers ==

List of known tracker domains names that link to a filtered list of torrents for that tracker, plus the following data aggregated per tracker:
 * number of loaded, active, incomplete, opened and closed torrents.
 * amount of data uploaded and downloaded.
 * average real and total ratio, where the real ratio incorporates just those torrents which have some actual download registered.

Note that these statistics only include the data of the torrents that are _currently_ loaded into rTorrent.
