= Introduction =

PyroScope is a collection of tools for the BitTorrent protocol and especially the rTorrent client. It offers the following components:
 * CommandLineTools for automation of common tasks, like metafile creation, and [RtControlExamples filtering and mass-changing your loaded torrents]
 * rTorrent extensions like a queue manager and statistics (currently planned)
 * a modern and versatile rTorrent web interface (currently on hold)

To get started right away, see the QuickStartGuide. It's also very easy to WriteYourOwnScripts to automate anything that the standard commands can't do. To get in contact and share your experiences with other users of PyroScope, join the [http://groups.google.com/group/pyroscope-users pyroscope-users] mailing list or the inofficial <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/rtorrent">`#rtorrent`</a> channel on `irc.freenode.net`.

The ScreenShotGallery has some older shots of the web interface (currently not actively developed), if you want to get a first impression without installing the software.
