== Views ==
PyroScope has the following views:
 * HomeView - Welcome page. 
 * TorrentsView - List torrents by different criteria and control them.
 * LaboratoryView - Testing grounds and technical information.
 * HelpView - What you are looking at.


== Browser Compatibility ==
PyroScope is designed for _Mozilla Firefox 3_ and will have no visual defects when used with that browser.

It is also briefly tested with _Internet Explorer 8_ from time to time. Unsurprisingly, there are some CSS problems and no rounded borders, but overall the user interface is usable.
