== Browser Compatibility ==
PyroScope is designed for _Mozilla Firefox 3_ and will have no visual defects when used with that browser.

It is also briefly tested with _Internet Explorer 8_ from time to time. Unsurprisingly, there are some CSS problems and no rounded borders, but overall the user interface is usable.
